## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant coral (#FF7F50) to evoke feelings of warmth, excitement, and connection, suitable for a dating app experience. This vibrant tone suggests the excitement of meeting someone new.
- Background color: A very light, desaturated coral (#FAF0E6) provides a gentle backdrop that doesn't distract from the content. Its lightness ensures that the vibrant primary and accent colors stand out effectively.
- Accent color: A complementary orange-red (#FF4500), offering high contrast for interactive elements like buttons or notifications. This bold color choice is close to the primary hue but distinct enough to draw attention.
